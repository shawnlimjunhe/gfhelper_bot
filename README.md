A telegram bot to help my girlfriend with tasks like being more punctual.

The main motivation for creating this project was that my girlfriend would frequently be late when we went out and this was a big deal of frustration for me as I would often be the one waiting for her. 

## Features
- Calculates sleep and wake times using the [90 minute rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewajc2eXZr0) `/sleep` 
- Time calculator so estimate when to leave the house `/est`


 More features in the works!
- [ ] Scheduled telegram reminders
- [ ] Route planner
- [ ] random hedgehog pictures (because my girlfriend loves hedgehogs)

### Testing gfhelper_bot locally
This guide assumes that you already have git and python 3.9 installed. 
To check whether you have git and python installed properly:

```bash
$ git --version
```

```bash
$ python --version
```

### 1. Clone the gfhelper_bot locally
Go the the directory where you want to store the cinnabot code, and run this command to download the gfhelper_bot repository into a new directory called 'gfhelper_bot' or any name of your choosing: 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shawnlimjunhe/gfhelper_bot.git
```

### 2. Install the required python libraries
To run this bot, we will need to install two python libraries
1) python-telegram-bot
2) python-dotenv

[python-telegram-bot](https://pypi.org/project/python-telegram-bot/) [(github)](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) is a Python wrapper for the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) and simplifies the development of Telegram bots using Python. 

To install python-telegram-bot using pip, run:
```bash
$ pip install python-telegram-bot
```

[python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) allows us to read key-value pairs from a `.env` file.

To install python-dotenv using pip, run:
```bash
$ pip install python-dotenv
```

### 3. Register for an API token with Botfather
Pay your respects to [Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) 

To create your own bot, send the following commands to BotFather

1) /start
2) /newbot

After naming your bot (non-unique) and giving it username (must be unique), Botfather will give your an API token.

### 4. Create a `.env` file
In the gfhelper_bot root directory, create a `.env` file using the following command

```
# unix
$ cp .env.example .env

# windows
$ copy .env.example .env
```


Load up your IDE of choice and replace the dummy API token with the API token that you have just created.

### 5. Running the script
```bash
$ python main.py
```

Your bot should be running! Open up telegram and search for your bot with the username that you gave and have fun! 

When you're done, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the bot.

Hope that it helps your significant other too! ü¶î

#### 5.1 Enabling Developer error messages
To allow the bot to send error logs to you, obtain your chat_id by paste the following code at the end of any command
```
print(update.effective_chat.id)
```

Paste the following into the `.env` file:
```
DEVELOPER_CHAT_ID = YOUR_CHAT_ID
```
